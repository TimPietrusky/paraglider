      description: 'I just got a Sony A7S and a Rokinon 14mm f2.8 lens, so I can go all out on my Nighttime in Nevada project, and this is from my first attempt at testing it out. It’s easily the most sophisticated camera that I’ve ever used, and I’m going to need to experiment with it for a while before I feel comfortable with getting the most out of its capabilities.',

      description: 'In the middle of July, I attempted a thru-hike on the Tahoe Rim Trail, and everything was going great until I slipped on a rock and severly dislocated my left index finger while trying to get up a side-trail to Mt. Tallac before sunset. It was a great week out in the backcountry, and even though I’m typing this one-hanfed I am glad I lugged around the heavy camera equipment for a week. Next year, I’ll try to finish it. Anyway, here’s one from the second night on the trail when I camped at Star Lake.',

I set my alarm for midnight and drove over to lovely Lake Tahoe, and thankfully nobody else was down at Bonsai Rock, and everything worked out.',

Thankfully, this time I knew better and didn’t arrive until about 2:30ish. I shot some timelapse footage and even flew my drone for a bit after sunrise, and I’ll have something about it on YouTube in a week or so...',
